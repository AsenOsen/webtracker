# ToDo

- keep cookies for popular web sites
- timer-based scrapping (30m, 1h, 5h, 24h)
- look at history snapshots
- on canvas click: do not open modal right away, ask user if he wants to over small popup
- spread fetching by domain name frequency 
	- use proxy if too fast even after spreading
	- use domain db with `domain` and `last_fetch` fields
- shrink snapshot data
	- if the same xpath detected in last 5 snapshots, make link instead of file
	- do not send repeated data to client (pass same points)
